1.

"static" ammount of cards

user id is generated at random

cards are stored in their own seperate table and are encoded with a value

we basically hard code (or come up with a function) that assigns value to a premade list of cards

we get to choose what our rarity distribution spread is

card owner variable is assigned null and only assigned when cards are opened


2.

cards are items of group pack

static ammount with rarity/value predetermined as above

cards can only be traded between users

pack is purely a get request of size(pack)


3.

dynamic / non defined card value

cards that have their own value distribution

packs are bouoght for higher prices if there is a better change of a higher value distribution spread

opening packs is a create request that generates cards in the database and assigns their user owner
upon generation
card_owner is never null
every time a user has a card added, it is also added to their ownership history

4.
cards are items of pack where pack contains a random selection of items from cards
value is not predetermined, but determined by frequency
card_owner is initially null
ownership history is subtable of type card
pack is ether predetermined if card number is static or dynamic and assigned value upon creation
if people can buy packs of multiple sizes
