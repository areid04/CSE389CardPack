---THIS IS A FILE TO HELP WITH DATABASE STRUCTURE--

for our project we have multiple options for what database structure
could be as simple as a text file but realistically from the list of the most common db types
(especially those that we are familiar with) this is my opinion for what we should use

Oracle
MySql
sqlite -------->>> this is the one i think we should use
txt file
mongodb/non sql databases

even though there would be some benefits to use a nosql database for a theoretically
infinite list of cards, there are a couple reasons why i like sqlite

    1. its preinstalled/able to be viewed and accessed from both microsoft, linux and mac
        shells with no additional hassle (hopefully)
    2. in our project, we are going to be working with realistically a relatively small list
    3. sqlite is on a single server and is based on files with no multi server clustering
    4. most if sqlite is basic CRUD operations which is prbobly all we are going to need for this
    5. there's already alot of documentation abt sqlite
    6. lots of additional extensions

    we can discuss more about the feasability of a nosql database, but for now im going to plan
    with sqlite


---------LOOK AT THIS LINK---------

this is the visualizer/ db schema i have used to visualizing and working with databases
yeahs its free and all that good stuff but the reason i think its helpful for everyone is
you can query the database and view the model and tables weithout having to know pretty much
any code.

this really helps me get a better idea of the stucture, and for whatever we use i think we should
all use this framework

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the last thing i think is worth mentioning is how we are going to use this database to interact
with other code.
i have use sqlite with c# and it is pretty much supported by every language
however, depending on what we mainly use and what server side support we use we will have to
cater the extensions accordingly

these are the only extensions i think we might end up using

value assigning
sha/ encryption

im planning to max out the cybersecurity stuff towards the end of the project after we have a basic
draft running
optimising safety even for a dataset below a couple thousand could be point farming for us

here is a list of thinks we can impliment

sql injection (solutions will vary depending on how much js we use)
xxs (validity/user checking on post requests)
anti-csrf tokens (not really related to this tho)


DO NOT CONCATENATE USER INPUT TO SQL STRINGS!!!

        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM cards WHERE id = ?", (user_input,))

         GOOD^^^^^^^

        db.run("SELECT * FROM cards WHERE name = '" + name + "'");



user/password db
user card inventory
user pack inventory
